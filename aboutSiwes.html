			In earlier years of science and technology education system in Nigeria, students were graduating from their respective institutions without acquiring any technical knowledge or work experience, which enables then to be exposed to the work force of the society. It was with this view that students undergo science and technology related courses in different institutions were required to partake in the SIWES program, designed to expose and prepare students of universities and other tertiary institution for the industrial work situation they are likely to face after graduation.

			The student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES) was established by the industrial trust fund (ITF) in 1973 with the aim of exposing students to machines and ways to safeguarding the work areas and workers in the industries, offices, laboratories, hospitals and other organization. The main reason behind the embankments of students in SIWES was to expose them to the industrial environment and enable them to develop occupational competencies so that they can readily contribute their quota to national economic and technological development after graduation.

			<h1 style="color: green; font-weight: 600">Benefit to students</h1>
			The major benefit to students who partake in the SIWES are the skills and competencies acquired. The relevant production skills remain a part of the recipients of industrial training as life-long assets which cannot be taken away from them. This is because the knowledge and skills acquired through training are internalized and become relevant when required to perform jobs.
